# Homework-Assignment-1
The first homework assignment - 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

In this assignment we were tasked with refactoring already existing code to meet accessibility standards so that the site in question would be optimized for search engines.

I went through the html code and made sure that it contained all semantic elements, instead of any vague ones, to ensure that anyone else looking at the code would know what each tag was right off the bat. In addition to this, I made sure that each of these elements followed a logical structure within the code, so that it was easier to comprehend by anyone else accessing it (this includes all of the heading elements to fall in sequential order as well). The title is descriptive as well so that there is no question as to what the site is.

The images all now contain an alt attribute so that in case they dont load for whatever reason, there is still a description of what the image is to give it context.

Both of the HTML file and the CSS file have been annotated to describe what is happening in each section of the code, making it easier to understand if opening this code with no prior knowledge to it.  The final product is clear, concise code, with a nice looking website.
